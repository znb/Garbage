# The Hive


[The Hive Project](https://thehive-project.org/) is awesome. You should use it !

This is a set of Terraform scripts to bring up a basic Hive + Cortex instance in AWS.
You'll need to do some minor configuration and tweaks, but this should take a lot
of the pain out of deploying The Hive.
